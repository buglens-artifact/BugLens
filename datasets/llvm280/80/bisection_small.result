98748c0 Teach instcombine's sext elimination logic to be more aggressive. Previously, instcombine would only promote an expression tree to the larger type if doing so eliminated two casts.  This is because a need to manually do the sign extend after the promoted expression tree with two shifts.  Now, we keep track of whether the result of the computation is going to be properly sign extended already.  If so, we can unconditionally promote the expression, which allows us to zap more sext's.
