fc8d9ee Implement rdar://6295824 and PR6724 with two tiny changes that can have a big effect :).  The first is to enable the iterative SCC passmanager juice that kicks in when the scc passmgr detects that a function pass has devirtualized a call.  In this case, it will rerun all the passes it manages on the SCC, up to the iteration count limit (4). This is useful because a function pass may devirualize a call, and we want the inliner to inline it, or pruneeh to infer stuff about it, etc.
